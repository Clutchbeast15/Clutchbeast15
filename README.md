## 🔥 About Me

🎯 **Mission:**  
Become an elite **Smart Contract Auditor**, uncovering vulnerabilities before the hackers do.

## 📌 Areas of Practice
- Shadow auditing real-world DeFi protocols 🔬  
- Mastering Foundry, Echidna, and advanced fuzzing techniques 🐞  
- Solving CTFs (Ethernaut, Damn Vulnerable DeFi) ⚔️  
- Analyzing DeFi hacks from [DeFiHackLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs) 💥  
- Writing real-world audit reports & PoCs ✍️



## 🧰 Tech Stack & Skills


- 💻 Solidity (v0.8.x) – writing secure smart contracts using modern patterns and best practices

- 🛠️ Foundry – writing unit tests with forge-std, debugging with console.log, and using cast for scripting

- 🔍 Static Analysis – familiar with tools like Slither and Aderyn for detecting vulnerabilities and security issues

- 🔐 Knowledge of Common Vulnerabilities – reentrancy, access control issues, tx.origin misuse, integer over/underflows, delegatecall abuse, and more


## 📂 Featured Projects

A selection of my top repositories showcasing my audit work, learning journey, and hands-on security research:

| 🚀 Project | 📝 Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| [🧠 Ethernaut__Solutions](https://github.com/clutchbeast15/Ethernaut__Solutions) | CTF challenges solved using Foundry with detailed vulnerability analysis and exploit reports. |
| [📋 Updraft-Security-Portfolio](https://github.com/clutchbeast15/Updraft-Security-Portfolio) | Audit reports written during the Cyfrin Smart Contract Security course. Demonstrates audit structure and methodology. |
| [🕵️‍♂️ Secudoku_Shadow_Audits](https://github.com/clutchbeast15/Secudoku_Shadow_Audits) | Shadow audits of real-world protocols — recreating and analyzing attack surfaces with PoCs and PDF reports. |





## 🚧 Ongoing Projects

- 📘 **Shadow Audits**  
  Currently Auditing restaking protocol.
  Writing detailed reports & PoCs.  

- ⚙️ **CTF Progress**  
  ✅ Ethernaut — [In Progress 🚀]  
  ✅ Damn Vulnerable DeFi — [Queued 🎯]  
  

- 🔍 **Exploit Analysis**  
  Deep-diving into hacks and understand them.



## 💬 Why Security?

⚖️ **"Code is law, but laws have loopholes. I hunt them."** 🕳️

Smart contract security is what keeps billions in DeFi alive.  
I love the thrill of exploring edge cases, breaking assumptions, and helping teams build **provably safer** protocols.



## 🌟 Vision & Values

- ✅ **Precision over speed**  
- 🔄 **Always verify. Never assume.**  
- 💭 **Learn in public. Fail forward. Audit better.**
